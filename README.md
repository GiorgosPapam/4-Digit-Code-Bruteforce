This code is designed to automatically attempt to type a series of numerical combinations as passwords using the PyAutoGUI and Pyperclip libraries. Here's a brief description of what each part of the code does:

  Imports:

      • pyautogui: Used for automating mouse and keyboard actions.
      • pyperclip: Used for clipboard operations.
      • time: Used for handling time-related functions.

  Function Definitions:

      • is_clipboard_same_as_number(number): Checks if the current clipboard content matches a given number.
      • get_seconds(): Prompts the user to input a number of seconds, which is validated and returned as an integer.
  
  Main Execution:

      • Prompts the user to enter the interval (in seconds) between password attempts.
      • A countdown from 5 seconds is displayed before starting the process.
      • Initializes a nested loop to generate all possible four-digit combinations (0000 to 9999).
      • For each combination:
            • Pauses for the user-defined interval.
            • Simulates mouse and keyboard actions to type the combination into a text field.
            • Copies the content of the text field to the clipboard.
            • Checks if the clipboard content matches the combination.
            • If the correct code is identified, it prints the code and stops further attempts.

The process ensures that it tries each possible combination and checks it by comparing the clipboard content to determine if it is the correct password.
